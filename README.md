# Belousov-Zhabotinsky Reactions Generator
Language: Java

In this program you can emulate this oscillating behaviour (with a healthy-infected-ill logic) with a wide variety of parameters.

A BelousovÂ–Zhabotinsky reaction, or BZ reaction, is one of a class of reactions that serve as a classical example of non-equilibrium thermodynamics, resulting in the establishment of a nonlinear chemical oscillator. (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Belousov%E2%80%93Zhabotinsky_reaction)
